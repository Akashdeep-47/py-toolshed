## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

Before running any scripts, it's highly recommended to set up a **virtual environment** to manage dependencies and avoid conflicts with your system's Python packages.

---

### 1. Clone the Repository

Open your terminal or command prompt and clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Akashdeep-47/py-toolshed.git
cd py-toolshed
```

---

## 2. Create and Activate Virtual Environment

A virtual environment keeps the required libraries isolated.

| Operating System | Command to Create        | Command to Activate           |
|------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Windows**      | `python -m venv venv`    | `.\venv\Scripts\activate`     |
| **macOS/Linux**  | `python3 -m venv venv`   | `source venv/bin/activate`    |

You should see `(venv)` prepended to your command prompt, indicating the environment is active.

---

## 3. Install Dependencies

Install all necessary Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
